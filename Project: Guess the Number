The "Guess the Number" game is a classic, text-based Java application that provides an entertaining and interactive way for users to test their guessing skills. In this project, you will create a Java program that generates a random number within a specified range and challenges the user to guess that number within a limited number of attempts.

Key Features:

    Random Number Generation: The program should generate a random number between a predefined minimum and maximum range. This range can be set by the user or hardcoded in the program.
    User Input: The program should prompt the user to enter their guesses and validate the input to ensure it's a valid integer within the specified range.
    Feedback: After each guess, the program should provide feedback to the user, indicating whether the guess is too high or too low. It should also keep track of the number of attempts.
    Win/Lose Conditions: The game should continue until the user correctly guesses the number or exceeds the maximum allowed attempts. You should display a win or lose message accordingly.
    Play Again: After the game ends, the program should ask the user if they want to play again. If they choose to play again, a new random number should be generated, and the game starts over.
    User-Friendly Interface: Create a user-friendly text-based interface with clear instructions and messages to guide the player through the game.

Learning Outcomes:

By completing these projects, you will be able to:

    Apply the use of loops to repeatedly execute code until a condition is met.
    Utilize random number generation in Java to create dynamic and unpredictable game elements.
    Develop problem-solving strategies to create a guessing game that provides feedback to the user.
    Enhance understanding of comparison operators and conditional logic to evaluate user guesses.
    Improve code readability and maintainability by structuring the game logic clearly and effectively.
